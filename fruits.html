    <h1>MY FAVORITE FRUITS</h1>
    <h2>Apple</h2>

        Kabaddi is a fast-paced team sport that originated in ancient India and is now popular across South Asia. It involves two teams taking turns to send a "raider" into the opponent's half to tag players and return without being tackled. The raider must chant "kabaddi" continuously while in enemy territory, adding a unique vocal challenge to the game. Strength, strategy, and agility are key to both attacking and defending. Kabaddi has gained international recognition, with leagues and tournaments held worldwide.
      The apple is one of the most popular and widely consumed fruits around the
      world. Known for its crisp texture and sweet-tart flavor, apples come in a
      variety of colors including red, green, and yellow. Rich in fiber,
      vitamins, and antioxidants, they are not only delicious but also offer
      numerous health benefits. Apples are often eaten fresh, but they can also
      be baked into pies, made into sauces, or pressed into juice. With their
      symbolic presence in folklore, mythology, and even science—think Newton’s
      apple—they hold a special place in both culture and cuisine.

    <h2>Banana</h2>

    <p>
      The banana is a soft, sweet fruit that grows in tropical regions and is
      loved for its convenience and nutritional value. Wrapped in a peel that’s
      easy to remove, bananas are a popular on-the-go snack. They are rich in
      potassium, vitamin B6, and dietary fiber, making them great for heart
      health and digestion. Bananas can be eaten fresh, blended into smoothies,
      baked into breads, or sliced over cereal. Their natural sugars provide a
      quick energy boost, and their creamy texture makes them a favorite in both
      sweet and savory dishes.

    <h2>other fruits that i like</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mango</li>
      <li>Grapes</li>
      <li>Chikku</li>
      <li>strawberry</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Mangoes, grapes, and strawberries are all delicious fruits, each with
      their own unique flavor and appeal. Mangoes are juicy and tropical, grapes
      are sweet and bite-sized, and strawberries offer a tangy burst of
      freshness. While they’re enjoyable in smoothies, desserts, or eaten fresh,
      I personally don’t like them as much as apples and bananas. Apples and
      bananas feel more satisfying and versatile to me—they’re my go-to
      favorites.
