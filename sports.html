      Kabaddi is a fast-paced team sport that originated in ancient India and is
      now popular across South Asia. It involves two teams taking turns to send
      a "raider" into the opponent's half to tag players and return without
      being tackled. The raider must chant "kabaddi" continuously while in enemy
      territory, adding a unique vocal challenge to the game. Strength,
      strategy, and agility are key to both attacking and defending. Kabaddi has
      gained international recognition, with leagues and tournaments held
      worldwide.
