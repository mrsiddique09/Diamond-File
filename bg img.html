    <h1>MY FAVORITE CARS</h1>
    <h3>
      Cars have always been more than just vehicles to me — they’re symbols of
      freedom, power, and personal style. Among my favorites are
      high-performance sports cars like the Ferrari 488 GTB and Lamborghini
      Aventador, which combine breathtaking speed with sculpted beauty. Their
      engines roar with authority, and every curve is designed for aerodynamic
      perfection. I also admire luxury sedans such as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class
      and BMW 7 Series, which offer a refined driving experience with plush
      interiors, cutting-edge technology, and smooth handling. SUVs like the
      Range Rover and Toyota Land Cruiser appeal to my adventurous side,
      offering rugged durability and spacious comfort for long journeys or
      off-road escapades. In recent years, electric vehicles have captured my
      imagination — especially the Tesla Model S and Porsche Taycan — for their
      silent acceleration, futuristic design, and commitment to sustainability.
      Classic cars like the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro evoke nostalgia,
      reminding me of a golden era of raw horsepower and timeless design. Each
      of these cars represents a different facet of my personality:
      thrill-seeker, comfort-lover, explorer, and innovator. Whether it's the
      adrenaline of a racetrack or the serenity of a long drive, my favorite
      cars make every journey unforgettable.
